FreeDatabase README
Welcome to TBD-FreeDatabase – Your Secure File Storage Solution

Overview
TBD-FreeDatabase is an open-source web application designed to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to store and manage their files without utilizing local storage resources. Our dedicated team has been working on this project since 2021, and
we're excited to share the final product with you.

Getting Started
To begin using TBD-FreeDatabase, follow these simple steps:

Create an Account: Join our community on Discord to create your FreeDatabase account. Once registered, you'll receive a unique login key.

Secure Login: Use your provided login key to securely access your database and take control of your file storage.

File Management: Upload or delete files seamlessly within the FreeDatabase interface. Enjoy the flexibility of managing your files without the hassle of local storage limitations.

Important Note
While FreeDatabase offers a user-friendly file storage solution, it's essential to be mindful of the project's early stage of development. We recommend refraining from storing sensitive information until our security measures are further enhanced.

Data Safety
As with any online platform, it's crucial to prioritize the safety of your data. We encourage users to maintain regular backups of their files independently. In the event of any unforeseen data loss, having a backup ensures that your files can be recovered.
